Driving question: What is the contribution of returning Australians to COVID-19 cases in Australia?

## Data wrangeling

To wrangle the data, first we need to standardise the column names for both NSW and VIC infection sources. After this, we'll merge the two datasets. 
```{r}

colnames(vic_cases) = colnames(nsw_cases) = c("date", "infection_source" )


vic_cases = vic_cases %>% mutate(infection_source = case_when(
  infection_source == "Travel overseas" ~ "international",
  infection_source == "Acquired in Australia, unknown source" ~ "domestic", 
  infection_source == "Contact with a confirmed case" ~ "domestic", 
  TRUE ~ infection_source
))

nsw_cases = nsw_cases %>% mutate(infection_source = case_when(
  infection_source == "Locally acquired - no links to known case or cluster" ~ "domestic", 
  infection_source == "Locally acquired - linked to known case or cluster"  ~ "domestic",
  infection_source == "Interstate" ~ "domestic", 
  infection_source == "Overseas" ~ "international"
))

vic_cases$state = rep("Victoria", nrow(vic_cases))
nsw_cases$state = rep("New South Wales", nrow(nsw_cases))

vic_cases = vic_cases %>% 
  group_by(state, date, infection_source) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = infection_source, values_from = count) %>% mutate(domestic = replace_na(domestic, 0),
                                                                             international = replace_na(international, 0))

nsw_cases = nsw_cases %>% group_by(state, date, infection_source) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = infection_source, values_from = count) %>%
  mutate(
    domestic = replace_na(domestic, 0),  
    international = replace_na(international, 0))


cases <- rbind(nsw_cases, vic_cases) %>% group_by(date, state, domestic, international)

# city data
colnames(au_cities)[2:3] = c("city", "state")
au_cities = au_cities[, 2:3]

# airport data 
colnames(airport_arrivals) = tolower(colnames(airport_arrivals)) 
airport_arrivals$airport = str_to_title(airport_arrivals$airport)
airport_arrivals = airport_arrivals %>% filter(year %in% c("2020", "2021")) 

au_cities = au_cities[au_cities$city %in% unique(airport_arrivals$airport),]


# for each airport, get the state
airport_arrivals = merge(au_cities, airport_arrivals, by.x = "city", by.y = "airport") 
airport_arrivals <- airport_arrivals %>% filter(state %in% c("New South Wales", "Victoria")) %>% mutate(date = make_date(year, month),                                                                               .keep = "unused",                                                               .before = 2)


```


## Data investigation 

What proportion of COVID-19 cases come from international arrivals? 


```{r}
cases_long <- cases %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("domestic", "international"), names_to = "infection_source", values_to = "cases") 

# Asela: I changed the frequency of the plot from month to week
cases_long_grpd <- cases_long %>% group_by(state, week = lubridate::floor_date(date, "week", week_start = 7), infection_source) %>% summarize(cases = sum(cases)) 


cases_long_grpd %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = cases, fill = infection_source)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")


p1 <- cases_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cases, fill = infection_source)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") + facet_wrap(~state, nrow=2) + theme_bw() + labs(title = "COVID-19 cases by infection source", x = "", y = "Daily COVID-19 cases", fill = "Infection source") 

ggplotly(p1)


```
